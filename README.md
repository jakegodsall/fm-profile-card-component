## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

1. That I need to use absolute height measurements for components, as different mobile screens have different heights. This was causing much of the content to be hidden because my relative units (vh) for container height weren't large enough.
2. How to use background image properties, i.e. `background-position`, `background-size` for multiple background images.
3. How to position an image over the interface between two containers using `position: relative`.


### Continued development

The CSS for this project in the end became a little unwieldy and so for the next project, I intend to try to use SASS. I shall continue to learn flexbox to get a more intuitive and natural ability for developing layouts. I intend to go through solutions given by others line for line because I do feel that my solution to this problem is very ameteur-like, and would like to start getting accustomed to best practices.

### Useful resources

- [BrowserStack Responsive](https://www.browserstack.com/responsive) - I used this tool to view the component on an array of common screen sizes. This allowed me to catch a few problems with the way I was thinking about determining size.
